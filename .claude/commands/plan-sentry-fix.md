# Plan Sentry Fix

Create a detailed implementation plan for fixing a Sentry issue by fetching issue details, thoroughly exploring the codebase, and producing a well-reasoned fix strategy.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS` contains the Sentry issue ID (e.g., `THENINJARPG-123`) or full Sentry URL.

## Process

### Step 1: Fetch Sentry Issue Details

Use the Sentry MCP tools to get issue details from the provided argument:

**$ARGUMENTS = `$ARGUMENTS`**

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is a Sentry URL, use `get_issue_details` with the `issueUrl` parameter
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` is an issue ID (e.g., `THENINJARPG-123`), use `get_issue_details` with:
   - `organizationSlug`: `studie-tech-aps`
   - `regionUrl`: `https://de.sentry.io`
   - `issueId`: the provided ID

**Important**: Do NOT use `analyze_issue_with_seer` - always analyze issues manually by exploring the codebase yourself. This ensures a thorough understanding of the code context and produces better fixes.

**Important**: Ensure that you fetch the latest event data from sentry. If permission error, do not look at any previous plans, but rather report back that Sentry could not be accessed.

Extract from the issue:

- **Issue ID**: The short ID like `THENINJARPG-XXX`
- **Error message**: The main error text
- **Stack trace**: File locations and line numbers where the error occurs
- **Frequency**: How often this error occurs
- **First/Last seen**: When the error started and last occurred
- **Tags/Context**: Any additional context like browser, OS, user info

### Step 2: Deep Codebase Exploration

**This is a critical step - do not rush it.**

Navigate to and carefully read the files mentioned in the stack trace:

1. **Read the error location**: Start with the exact file and line number where the error occurs
2. **Understand the call chain**: Trace back through the stack trace to understand how the code reached this point
3. **Examine related code**: Look at:
   - The function/method containing the error
   - Functions that call this code
   - Functions that this code calls
   - Related types, interfaces, and data structures
   - Similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase
4. **Check for existing patterns**: Search for how similar issues are handled elsewhere:
   - Error handling patterns
   - Null/undefined checks
   - Validation patterns
   - Retry logic

**Questions to answer during exploration**:

- What is the exact condition that causes this error?
- What data or state leads to this condition?
- Is this a race condition, timing issue, or data validation problem?
- Are there edge cases not being handled?
- Is this error reproducible or intermittent?
- What upstream changes might have introduced this issue?

### Step 3: Root Cause Analysis

Based on your exploration, document:

1. **Root Cause**: The fundamental reason the error occurs
2. **Trigger Conditions**: What specific data, state, or sequence of events triggers it
3. **Impact Assessment**: How severe is this issue? What user actions are affected?
4. **Contributing Factors**: Any code patterns or architectural issues that made this bug possible
5. **Argumentation**: Key insights from sentry (stacktrace, events, etc.) used to conclude this is the root cause

### Step 4: Develop Fix Strategy

Consider multiple approaches to fixing the issue:

1. **Option A**: [First approach - describe]

   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

2. **Option B**: [Alternative approach - describe]
   - Pros: ...
   - Cons: ...

Select the best approach based on:

- Minimal code changes
- Consistency with existing patterns
- No introduction of new bugs
- Proper error handling
- Maintainability

### Step 5: Create Implementation Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan document with the following structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [SENTRY_ISSUE_ID]

## Issue Summary

- **Sentry Issue**: [ID with link]
- **Error**: [Brief error description]
- **Frequency**: [How often it occurs]
- **Impact**: [User/system impact]

## Root Cause Analysis

[Detailed explanation of what causes this error]

### Argumentation

[Key insights from Sentry (stacktrace, breadcrumbs, events, etc.) that led to this conclusion]

## Files to Modify

1. `path/to/file1.ts` - [What changes are needed]
2. `path/to/file2.ts` - [What changes are needed]

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Description]

- [ ] Specific change to make
- [ ] Code snippet or approach

### Step 2: [Description]

- [ ] Specific change to make

... (continue for all steps)

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] How to verify the fix works
- [ ] Edge cases to test
- [ ] Regression testing considerations

## Risk Assessment

- Potential side effects: [List any]
- Rollback plan: [If fix causes issues]
```

### Step 6: Save the Plan

Save the implementation plan to: `.claude/tasks/[DATETIME]_[SENTRY_ID]_PLAN-[random]-[identifier].md`

Where:

- `[DATETIME]` is the current date and time in format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` (e.g., `20250131-143052`)
- `[SENTRY_ID]` is the Sentry issue ID with hyphens removed (e.g., `THENINJARPG123`)
- `[random]` is a set of 6 random lowercase letters to create a unique plan ID
- `[identifier]` is a short description of the fix (e.g., `null_check`, `retry_logic`)

Example: `.claude/tasks/20250131-143052_THENINJARPG123_PLAN-fdosdg-fix_null_reference.md`

### Step 7: Validate the Plan (Critical)

**Before finalizing, critically evaluate the implementation plan:**

1. **Re-read the Sentry error details** - Does the plan actually address the root cause?
2. **Trace through the fix mentally** - Will the proposed changes prevent the error from occurring?
3. **Check for completeness** - Are all affected code paths covered?
4. **Verify consistency** - Does the fix follow existing codebase patterns?
5. **Consider edge cases** - What happens in unusual scenarios?
6. **Evaluate risk** - Could this fix introduce new issues?

**Ask yourself**:

- [ ] Does this fix address the ACTUAL root cause, not just a symptom?
- [ ] Have I considered all the ways this code path can be reached?
- [ ] Is there any scenario where this fix would not work?
- [ ] Am I introducing any new failure modes?
- [ ] Is this the simplest fix that solves the problem?

If any validation check fails, return to Step 2-5 and refine the analysis and plan.

## Output

After completing all steps, report:

1. **Plan saved to**: `[path to saved plan file]`
2. **Summary**: Brief description of the issue and proposed fix
3. **Argumentation**: Key insights from sentry (stacktrace, events, etc.) used to conclude this is the fix
4. **Confidence level**: How confident you are that this fix will resolve the issue
5. **Next steps**: Instructions for implementing the fix (use `/implement [plan_path]`)

## Important Notes

- **Take your time** - A thorough analysis prevents multiple fix attempts
- **Never use `analyze_issue_with_seer`** - Manual analysis produces better understanding
- **Check existing patterns** - The codebase likely has similar error handling you can follow
- **Document assumptions** - If you're uncertain about something, note it in the plan
- **Be skeptical** - Question your own analysis before finalizing
