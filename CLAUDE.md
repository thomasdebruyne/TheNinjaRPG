# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Primary Development:**

- `make start` - Start Next.js dev server at http://127.0.0.1:3000
- `make build` - Build the Next.js application
- `make test` - Run unit tests with vitest
- `make lint` - Run ESLint on the codebase
- `bun typecheck` - Type check TypeScript (from app directory)

**Database Management:**

- `make dbpush` - Push schema changes to database without migrations
- `make makemigrations` - Generate database migration files
- `make seed` - Seed database with initial data
- `make emptymigration` - Create empty migration file

**Package Management:**

- `make bun add [package]` - Add new package dependency
- `make install` - Install dependencies with bun

**Setup Commands:**

- `make setup` - Install bun and start required services
- `make help` - Show all available make commands

## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js 15 application using the App Router, built as a browser-based RPG game called "TheNinja-RPG". The stack includes:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI components
- **Database**: MySQL with Drizzle ORM
- **API**: tRPC for type-safe API endpoints
- **Auth**: Clerk for authentication
- **State Management**: Jotai for client state
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber

## Key Directories

### `/app/src/app/` - Next.js App Router Pages

Contains all route pages following Next.js 15 App Router conventions. Key pages include:

- `combat/` - Real-time combat system
- `profile/` - User profile management
- `manual/` - Admin content management system
- `village/` - Village/faction system

### `/app/src/server/api/` - tRPC Backend

- `root.ts` - Main tRPC router aggregating all sub-routers
- `routers/` - Individual feature routers (40+ routers)
- `trpc.ts` - tRPC configuration and middleware

### `/app/src/libs/` - Feature-Specific Logic

Core game systems organized by feature:

- `combat/` - Complex turn-based combat system (see Combat System section)
- `travel/` - 3D world map and movement system
- `bounty/` - Bounty hunting system
- Plus libraries for bloodlines, items, jutsu, clans, etc.

### `/app/src/validators/` - Zod Schemas

Shared validation schemas between frontend and backend using Zod.

### `/app/src/layout/` - Reusable UI Components

Custom components specific to the game (beyond basic Shadcn components).

### `/app/drizzle/` - Database Layer

- `schema.ts` - Complete database schema (40+ tables)
- `constants.ts` - Database constants and enums
- `migrations/` - Database migration files

## Combat System Architecture

The combat system is the most complex feature, with dedicated files:

**Core Files:**

- `combat/actions.ts` - Action availability and processing logic
- `combat/process.ts` - Round processing and effect application
- `combat/tags.ts` - Effect definitions (damage, healing, buffs, etc.)
- `combat/types.ts` - Zod schemas and TypeScript types
- `combat/util.ts` - Utility functions shared across combat system
- `combat/database.ts` - Database operations for combat
- `combat/ai_v2.ts` - AI behavior logic (rule-based system)
- `combat/drawing.ts` - Three.js rendering for combat visuals

**Key Functions:**

- `initiateBattle()` in `routers/combat.ts` - Start battles between users/AI
- `performAction()` in `routers/combat.ts` - Process user actions in combat

## Database Patterns

- Uses Drizzle ORM with MySQL
- Prefer query syntax over raw SQL
- Always try to use `Promise.all()` for parallel database operations
- Avoid transactions; use guards with where-statements instead
- Schema is centralized in `@/drizzle/schema.ts`

## tRPC Patterns

- All API endpoints use tRPC for type safety
- Mutations follow pattern: queries → guards → mutation
- Mutations return `baseServerResponse` from `@/server/api/trpc`
- Check existing endpoints to avoid duplication
- Structure endpoints consistently across routers

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Functional and declarative patterns (avoid classes)
- Prefer named exports for components
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs
- Directory names: lowercase with dashes
- Component file structure: exported component → subcomponents → helpers → types

## UI/Styling Guidelines

- Use Shadcn UI and Radix components
- Prioritize components from `/app/src/layout/` for reusability
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind
- Optimize for Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID)

## Permission System

Centralized permission logic in `/app/src/utils/permissions.ts`.

## External Services

- **Clerk** - Authentication (required for local dev)
- **UploadThing** - File uploads (optional)
- **Replicate** - AI inference (optional)
- **Sentry** - Error monitoring
- **Pusher** - Real-time features

## Development Setup Notes

- Copy `app/.env.example` to `app/.env` and configure service keys
- Database runs in Docker via `make setup`
- Admin panel at http://127.0.0.1:3001 for database management
- Use `make help` to see all available commands

## Testing

- Unit tests with Vitest
- Test files alongside source files
- Run tests with `make test`
